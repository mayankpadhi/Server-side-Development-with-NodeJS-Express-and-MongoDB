# NodeJS, Express and MongoDB

## Server side Development with NodeJS, Express and MongoDB
https://www.coursera.org/learn/server-side-nodejs/home

I examined NodeJS and NodeJS modules: Express for building web servers. On the database side, I reviewed basic CRUD operations, NoSQL databases, in particular MongoDB and Mongoose for accessing MongoDB from NodeJS. Got an insight of REST concepts and building a RESTful API. Touched upon authentication and security. Learned about backend as a service (BaaS) approaches, including mobile BaaS, both open-source and commercial BaaS services.
At the end of this project I was able to:
*	Demonstrate an understanding of server-side concepts, CRUD and REST
*	Build and configure a backend server using NodeJS framework
*	Build a RESTful API for the front-end to access backend services.
